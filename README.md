## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Implementation Details

### 🌐 Frontend (Server-Side Rendered)

- **HTML5**  
  Semantic markup for structured and accessible web pages.

- **CSS3**  
  Custom styling for layouts, forms, cards, and responsive design.

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**  
  Client-side interactivity and dynamic UI behavior.

- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)**  
  Server-side templating for rendering dynamic views and reusable components.

---

### ⚙️ Backend

- **Node.js**  
  JavaScript runtime for building scalable and efficient backend services.

- **Express.js**  
  Minimal web framework used for routing, middleware, and API development.

- **RESTful API Architecture**  
  Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for listings, users, and reviews.

---

### 🗄️ Database & ODM

- **MongoDB**  
  NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.

- **Mongoose**  
  ODM library used for schema definitions, validations, and managing relationships.

---

### 🔐 Authentication & Security

- **Passport.js**  
  Authentication middleware for handling user login and sessions.

- **bcrypt**  
  Secure password hashing before storing credentials.

- **Session Management**  
  Express sessions used to maintain authentication state.

- **Authorization Middleware**  
  Ensures only authorized users can create, edit, or delete listings and reviews.

---

### ☁️ File Upload & Storage

- **Cloudinary**  
  Cloud-based image storage and optimization.

- **Multer**  
  Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` during image uploads.

---

### ✅ Validation & Error Handling

- **Joi**  
  Server-side validation to prevent invalid or malicious inputs.

- **Centralized Error Handling**  
  Custom error classes and middleware for consistent error responses.

- **Flash Messages**  
  User-friendly success and error notifications.

---

### 🧰 Development Practices

- **MVC Architecture**  
  Clear separation of Models, Views, and Controllers.

- **Middleware-Driven Design**  
  Reusable middleware for authentication, validation, and error handling.

- **Environment Variables**  
  Sensitive configuration managed using `.env` files.

- **Git & GitHub**  
  Version control and project collaboration.
